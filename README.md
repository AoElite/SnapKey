**TL;DR**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Without SnapKey:** 

Holding both keys simultaneously prevents your character from moving.

**With SnapKey:** 

SnapKey automatically releases a previously held key when a new key is pressed and held down (A/D).

**About SnapKey**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SnapKey offers a simple and intuitive alternative to the Razer Snap Tap function, making it accessible across all keyboards!

SnapKey is a lightweight open source utility that runs in the system tray and is designed to monitor user inputs for the A and D keys, without engaging with any game files. 

Its primary function is to detect when these keys are pressed and promptly cancel any previously held commands for them. 

This ensures that inputs are responsive and accurate, it operates exclusively to manage the A and D key inputs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Here’s how it works:**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- When you press and hold down the "A" key, SnapKey remembers it.
- If you then press the "D" key while still holding down "A," SnapKey automatically releases the "A" key for you.
- The same happens if you press "A" while holding "D" — SnapKey releases the "D" key.

It's particularly useful for gamers seeking quick and precise key control.
