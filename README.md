SnapKey is a lightweight open source utility that runs in the system tray.

SnapKey helps you quickly switch between the "A" and "D" keys on your keyboard.

Here’s how it works:
- When you press and hold down the "A" key, SnapKey remembers it.
- If you then press the "D" key while still holding down "A," SnapKey automatically releases the "A" key for you.
- The same happens if you press "A" while holding "D" — SnapKey releases the "D" key.

It's particularly useful for gamers seeking quick and precise key control.
